## Status

This project is used in production at Twitter and is being actively developed and maintained. Feel

## What is Diffy?

Diffy finds potential bugs in your service using running instances of your new code and your old
code side by side. Diffy behaves as a proxy and multicasts whatever requests it receives to each of
the running instances. It then compares the responses, and reports any regressions that may surface
from those comparisons. The premise for Diffy is that if two implementations of the service return
“similar” responses for a sufficiently large and diverse set of requests, then the two
implementations can be treated as equivalent and the newer implementation is regression-free.
For a more detailed analysis of Diffy checkout this [blogpost](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/a/2015/diffy-testing-services-without-writing-tests.html).

## How does Diffy work?

Diffy acts as a proxy that accepts requests drawn from any source that you provide and multicasts
each of those requests to three different service instances:

1. A candidate instance running your new code
2. A primary instance running your last known-good code
3. A secondary instance running the same known-good code as the primary instance

As Diffy receives a request, it is multicast and sent to your candidate, primary, and secondary
instances. When those services send responses back, Diffy compares those responses and looks for two
things:

1. Raw differences observed between the candidate and primary instances.
2. Non-deterministic noise observed between the primary and secondary instances. Since both of these
   instances are running known-good code, you should expect responses to be in agreement. If not,
   your service may have non-deterministic behavior, which is to be expected.

Diffy measures how often primary and secondary disagree with each other vs. how often primary and
candidate disagree with each other. If these measurements are roughly the same, then Diffy
determines that there is nothing wrong and that the error can be ignored.

## How to get started?
# Running the example
The example.sh script included here builds and launches example servers as well as a diffy instance. Verify
that the following ports are available (9000, 9100, 9200, 8880, 8881, & 8888) and run `./example/run.sh start`.

Once your local Diffy instance is deployed, you send it a few requests
like `curl --header "Canonical-Resource: Json" localhost:8880/json?Twitter`. You can then go to your browser at
[http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) to see what the differences across our example instances look like.

# Digging deeper
That was cool but now you want to compare old and new versions of your own service. Here’s how you can
start using Diffy to compare three instances of your service:

1. Deploy your old code to `localhost:9990`. This is your primary.
2. Deploy your old code to `localhost:9991`. This is your secondary.
3. Deploy your new code to `localhost:9992`. This is your candidate.
4. Download the latest Diffy binary from maven central or build your own from the code using `./sbt assembly`.
5. Run the Diffy jar with following command line arguments:

    ```
    java -jar diffy-server.jar \
    -candidate=localhost:9992 \
    -master.primary=localhost:9990 \
    -master.secondary=localhost:9991 \
    -service.protocol=http \
    -serviceName=My-Service \
    -proxy.port=:8880 \
    -admin.port=:8881 \
    -http.port=:8888 \
    -rootUrl='localhost:8888'
    ```

6. Send a few test requests to your Diffy instance on its proxy port:

    ```
    curl localhost:8880/your/application/route?with=queryparams
    ```

7. Watch the differences show up in your browser at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).

## Using Diffy with Docker

You can pull the official docker image with `docker pull diffy/diffy`

And run it with
```
docker run -ti \
  -p 8880:8880 -p 8881:8881 -p 8888:8888 \
  diffy/diffy \
    -candidate=localhost:9992 \
    -master.primary=localhost:9990 \
    -master.secondary=localhost:9991 \
    -service.protocol=http \
    -serviceName="Test-Service" \
    -proxy.port=:8880 \
    -admin.port=:8881 \
    -http.port=:8888 \
    -rootUrl=localhost:8888
```

You should now be able to point to:
 - http://localhost:8888 to see the web interface
 - http://localhost:8881/admin for admin console
 - Use port 8880 to make the API requests

To build from source you can run `docker build -t diffy .`

## FAQ's
   For safety reasons `POST`, `PUT`, ` DELETE ` are ignored by default . Add ` -allowHttpSideEffects=true ` to your command line arguments to enable these verbs.
   
   You can send different HTTP Header Key value pairs to candidate, primary and secondary servers. Add `-candidateHeaders=Authorization:Basic OtxGHYUI, userRole:admin1 -primaryHeaders=Authorization:Basic NjhmskT, userRole:admin2 -secondaryHeaders=Authorization:Basic Tysfdg, userRole:admin3` to your command line arguments
   
   You can add apiRoots to the api calls to candidate, primary and secondary servers. Add `-candidateApiRoot="api/v2" -primaryApiRoot="api/v1" -secondaryApiroot="api/v1"` to your command line arguments. Usage:- ```curl 'localhost:8880/getAllMessages'``` will send a request ```candidateServer:candidatePort/api/v2/getAllMessages``` to candidate server while it will send ```primaryServer:primaryPort/api/v1/getAllMessages``` to primary server
   
   You can now substitute different queryParam values before multicasting to the three different servers. Usage:-  ```curl 'localhost:8880/api/getUserMessages?message=userId'```. Create a file apiParams.xml with the following structure
	```<apiParams>
	  <userId>
		<candidate>
		  12
		</candidate>
		<primary>
		  13
		</primary>
		<secondary>
		  14
		</secondary>
	  </userId>
	</apiParams>
	```
This will send a request ```candidateServer:candidatePort/api/getUserMessages?message=12``` to candidate server while sending ```primaryServer:primaryPort/api/getUserMessages?message=13``` and ```secondaryServer:secondaryPort/api/getUserMessages?message=14``` request to primary and secondary servers respectively.

## HTTPS
If you are trying to run Diffy over a HTTPS API, the config required is:

    -service.protocol=https

And in case of the HTTPS port be different than 443:

    -https.port=123
